## About 
This project is an email spam classifier that was created using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The project analyzes data from the dataset and determines if an email is spam or not. The Naive Bayes algorithm was used because it is known to work exceptionally well with natural language processing which was exactly what was needed in this case. It was done on Jupyter Notebook and the programming language is Python. I have used multiple python libraries for analyzing the spam email data such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Sklearn.
The dataset is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset fromt he UCI ML Repository.  
## Why
This project was created because of an issue that arose while I was working at a small company. We were sending out cold emails reaching out to potential partners and was receiving almost no answers. Luckily during that time I was taking a class at my university related to AI, we also had an end-of-semester project which lead me to trying to solve the companies issue about wether or not their emails were ending up in the potential clients' spam folder and also get my project done for the class. 2 birds with one stone. Thus this project was developed. 

## Future Endeavors
This project can be potentially turned into an app that will accept an email that you have just drafted and want to send out, the app analyzes your email determining if it will end up in the receivers spam folder or not.
